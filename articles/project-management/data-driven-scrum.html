            <p>SCRUM &mdash; a framework loved by some and loathed by many. Let&rsquo;s be honest, most of the hate
                comes from developers. But why? Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland were developers themselves. They
                created Scrum to solve the very organizational problems they faced. Surely it was meant to make life
                easier for developers?</p>
            <p>In principle, yes. Unfortunately, in practice, Scrum often suffers because the role of the Scrum Master
                is filled by someone who doesn&rsquo;t fully understand the work. The result? Things don&rsquo;t go as
                smoothly as they should.</p>
            <p>Scrum rests on <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/three-pillars-empiricism-scrum">three
                    pillars</a>: <strong>Transparency</strong>, <strong>Inspection</strong>, and
                <strong>Adaptation</strong>. When used correctly, they keep teams healthy and productive. But in
                reality, I&rsquo;ve seen these pillars ignored or applied half-heartedly. Retrospectives become a
                formality with no real follow-up. Daily stand-ups turn into status reports for the Scrum Master rather
                than coordination tools for the team. And teams are pushed to deliver &ldquo;above and beyond&rdquo; at
                the expense of sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>This culture breeds resentment. Developers don&rsquo;t just dislike the process &mdash; they begin to
                hate Scrum itself. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve seen many pitfalls Scrum Masters fall into (including a
                few I&rsquo;ve stumbled into myself). But today, I want to focus on one specific piece that often gets
                neglected or misunderstood: <strong>internal reporting</strong>.</p>
            <h2><strong>Transparency: Using Reporting to See Clearly</strong></h2>
            <p>When I first entered project management, I saw reporting as nothing more than a way to update clients or
                management. That&rsquo;s how most people treat it. Luckily, early in my career, I crossed paths with Ana
                Vintila, a brilliant Agile Coach who showed me what reporting could really do.</p>
            <p>When I became a Scrum Master, I inherited a fantastic reporting structure. We tracked <strong>Delivery
                    KPIs</strong>, <strong>Team Health KPIs</strong>, and <strong>Narrative Data</strong> &mdash; a
                combination that gave us a 360&deg; view of the team&rsquo;s performance and morale.</p>
            <img src="/articles/project-management/src/img/Team Cronus Delivery Metrics.png">
            <p>For example, in one project, sprints 55 to 63 showed a consistent drop across all KPIs. From sprint 64
                onwards, things improved. What changed? Well, I&rsquo;d love to say it was just me becoming Scrum Master
                (ðŸ˜‰), but the truth was that the team was drowning in poorly managed dependencies. We were forced to
                take on work blocked by other teams, based on the assumption things could be done in parallel. In
                reality, linked dependencies caused constant delays and frustration. The breakthrough came when I, used
                my finding tt negotiate with the Product Owner and Project Manager to shift focus toward simpler,
                lower-priority work first, then gradually reintroduce complex, dependency-heavy tickets.</p>
            <p>The takeaway? Without <strong>clear, structured reporting</strong>, that pattern might never have been
                spotted and it helped with clearly communicating the issue during negociations.</p>
            <h3><strong>Building a Reporting Framework</strong></h3>
            <p>For each project, the reporting structure must be tailored. I use three categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Delivery KPIs</strong> &ndash; Metrics like velocity, spillover (unfinished story points),
                    and capacity.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Team Health KPIs</strong> &ndash; Planning confidence, happiness (sometimes split into
                    satisfaction with the team, the project, and cross-team collaboration).<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Data</strong> &ndash; Brief but descriptive notes from retrospectives that explain
                    context behind the numbers.<br /><br /></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Consistently capturing accurate, relevant data enables <strong>Transparency</strong> &mdash; the first
                pillar of Scrum. But raw numbers aren&rsquo;t enough. You need to make them <strong>visible</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply conditional formatting.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Use charts or even simple arrows to highlight trends.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Present the data so it can be understood at a glance.<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/articles/project-management/src/img/Team Cronus Sheet.png">
            <h2><strong>Inspect: Finding the Patterns</strong></h2>
            <p>Once the data is clear, the next pillar &mdash; <strong>Inspection</strong> &mdash; comes into play.
                Here&rsquo;s my approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Correlate delivery metrics</strong> &ndash; Compare capacity and velocity to see if the team
                    is delivering as much as it can realistically handle.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Assess spillover trends</strong> &ndash; Look for recurring unfinished work and link it to
                    planning confidence or dependencies.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Factor in team health</strong> &ndash; Declining morale or confidence can signal burnout or
                    poor planning.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>Use narrative data for context</strong> &ndash; Numbers show <em>what</em> happened;
                    narrative data explains <em>why</em>.<br /><br /></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Look for cause-and-effect patterns. Example: The team&rsquo;s dev lead left, which reduced technical
                capacity, which lowered morale, which then reduced velocity.</p>
            <p>Finally, turn findings into actionable advice &mdash; practical steps the team can take to address
                problems.</p>
            <h2><strong>Adapt: Turning Insight into Action</strong></h2>
            <p>Data without action is useless. <strong>Adaptation</strong> means using insights to make targeted,
                incremental changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low velocity vs. high capacity &rarr; Remove blockers or adjust workload.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>High spillover &rarr; Improve backlog refinement or commit to less work.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Low planning confidence &rarr; Strengthen estimation and preparation.<br /><br /></li>
                <li>Dropping happiness &rarr; Address workload balance, team autonomy, or interpersonal
                    issues.<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Changes should be small, measurable, and tested for a sprint. Review metrics afterward to confirm the
                impact. Involve the whole team &mdash; adaptation works best when everyone owns it. This creates a
                feedback loop: <strong>Transparency &rarr; Inspect &rarr; Adapt &rarr; Repeat</strong>.</p>
            <h2><strong>AI as a Scrum Ally</strong></h2>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s face it &mdash; maintaining this level of reporting and analysis is tedious. This is where AI
                can help. Not replace humans (that&rsquo;s impossible in Scrum), but assist in processing large data
                sets and spotting patterns.</p>
            <p>One method I use is the <strong>CREATE</strong> formula for prompt engineering, especially when
                anonymizing sensitive data with placeholders like [CLIENT_ORGANIZATION] or [John Doe].</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C</strong>haracter &ndash; Define who the AI should act as (e.g., a project manager
                    analyzing KPIs).<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>R</strong>equest &ndash; State exactly what you want (e.g., analyze KPI trends and give
                    actionable recommendations).<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>E</strong>xample &ndash; Show the AI the output format and style you expect.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>djust &ndash; Correct the AI when it goes off track.<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>T</strong>ype &ndash; Specify the exact output format (bullets, tables,
                    narrative).<br /><br /></li>
                <li><strong>E</strong>valuate &ndash; Always check the AI&rsquo;s work for accuracy.<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI can save time, but it can also hallucinate. Always review results critically and ensure stakeholders
                agree on its use.</p>
            <h2><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2>
            <p>Most Scrum Masters don&rsquo;t apply this method because it&rsquo;s effort-heavy. But when done right,
                internal reporting creates a foundation for real transparency, sharp inspection, and meaningful
                adaptation. Add AI as a helper &mdash; not a crutch &mdash; and you can turn raw numbers into the kind
                of insight that keeps teams healthy, productive, and maybe even&hellip; a little more in love with
                Scrum.</p>
