    "title": "Will To Moral",
    "summary": "A reflection on Nietzsche’s idea of the “Will to Power,” once tied to imperialism and authoritarianism, and how it has transformed in modern times. While Nietzsche dismissed democracy and equality as weakness, today’s most successful nations are democratic, thriving on creativity, innovation, and shared morality rather than conquest. I reflect on how will to power has evolved from individual domination to the collective shaping of societal morals—seen in various movements. Ultimately, power in modern societies is rooted less in rulers and more in shared values that continue to evolve.",
