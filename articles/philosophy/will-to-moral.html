    <meta property='og:description' content='A reflection on Nietzsche’s idea of the “Will to Power,” once tied to imperialism and authoritarianism, and how it has transformed in modern times. While Nietzsche dismissed democracy and equality as weakness, today’s most successful nations are democratic, thriving on creativity, innovation, and shared morality rather than conquest. I reflect on how will to power has evolved from individual domination to the collective shaping of societal morals—seen in various movements. Ultimately, power in modern societies is rooted less in rulers and more in shared values that continue to evolve.'/>

            <p>We live in quite a chaotic world, split into two, where a nation can invade another because of the
                archaic beliefs of a delusional dictator. But there are also first-world countries that follow ideals of
                tolerance and equality, allowing them to live comfortable lives without needing any form of domination.
                Why is that?</p>
            <p>Over 2 years ago, I finally got my hands on one of the most influential works of Nietzsche. &ldquo;Beyond
                good and evil&rdquo;. This is said to have influenced major events in history, specifically due to the
                concept of Will to Power, which Hitler used as a basis for his twisted worldview. In essence, it is a
                primal desire of any living being to increase its influence over its surroundings. He argued that this
                is the primary goal of any man, overshadowing the need for survival or leaving offspring.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Objectively speaking, it is clear that Nietzsche's view on power, democracy, and equality is archaic; he
                believed that equality is weak and democracy is degenerative. However, let&rsquo;s take a look at the G7
                countries, which are considered to be the most successful nations in the world. All of them are
                democracies. And yet, they are much more successful than those nations that follow autocratic rulers.
            </p>
            <p>Some 50 years ago, the previous generations were dead focused on fighting wars in the name of freedom,
                communism, or religion; in reality, they were fought to increase a ruler's power. Thankfully, this is
                slowly becoming a thing of the past. Yes, some can argue that we have wars, the Russo-Ukrainian war,
                wars in the Middle East, or Africa, but let me provide some facts.</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the country that was first to introduce human rights, shaping the shift of Western
                Civilization towards democracy. The UK, as a colonialist empire, fought its last aggressive war in the
                19th century. The United States fought its last aggressive war in the early XX century. Belgium,
                Germany, Austria, and the old European countries eventually stopped aggression altogether.</p>
            <p>Nietzsche believed the act of a nation moving away from this barbarian urge to dominate was a sign of
                weakness. In reality, it is a sign of a maturing nation. The US and UK, democracies, and the Soviet
                Union, which publicly positioned itself to be people-oriented, came out as victors in WWII. And
                generally speaking, when was the last time those weak countries, according to Nietzsche, lost a major
                war? Instead, their equality breeds creativity, high morale, and eventually staggering innovation.
                Totalitarian states can&rsquo;t invent an iPhone. All they can manage is making a cheap rip-off that
                would only be ok.</p>
            <p>But what about Will To Power in democracies? Did it vanish? Nietzsche emphasized that Will To Power is
                crucial for a human being, that it is more important than the will to survive. That we live to gain
                power. I don&rsquo;t think it vanished. Instead, it evolved with our society. Just think of this, will
                to power in Nietzsche&rsquo;s times was revolving around imperialism and authoritarianism, which is
                drastically different from the times when we lived in caves, and will to power meant being stronger and
                owning a stronger club. In essence, will to power is adjusted to its surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s look at how the more mature nations are led. Authoritarianism is not possible as the will of
                the people is what drives a mature nation. And societies are led not by an individual, but by common
                morals. Now, I am not talking of the archaic concepts of morals coming from Christianity or any other
                religious origins. Morality adjusts to times and is a living part of any growing nation. I am talking of
                a nation&rsquo;s morality. Morality, as the guiding light for people, which dictates what a good citizen
                should do to be socially accepted.</p>
            <p>Yes, we elect politicians, presidents, and so on, but in mature nations, they are accountable for their
                behaviour; thus, they need to follow the same moral principles or risk losing power. This way, the will
                to power is shifted not to an individual but to the public. Making their morality and public image a way
                to control their actions. This is why public groups are gaining power by defining what is moral and what
                is not, which means the will to power has evolved to the will to define what is moral. Homophobia,
                bigotry, sexism, racism&hellip; all become shunned in modern societies, affecting the political and
                corporate powers.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ll admit the modern iteration of will to power has its quarks. The biggest one is Cancel Culture.
                Where people are being &ldquo;canceled&rdquo; by a mob that is mad for sometimes meaningless things. But
                it&rsquo;s still better than the Master-Slave dynamic, so common till the 19th century. What form shall
                the will to power take in the future? Who knows. But it will evolve to something that will suit our
                civilization better. Because the modern will to dictate what is moral, can not be our guiding light
                forever.</p>
