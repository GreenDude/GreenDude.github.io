            <p>&ldquo;Going above and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It's something I've heard since my first day in the tech industry. Back then, I thought it
                was a simple truth: if you want to succeed, work harder, give more. But over time, I started to wonder:
                why would people go above and beyond for &ldquo;just a job&rdquo;? And, closer to becoming a Scrum
                Master, I began to see that the real answer wasn't about effort at all, but about meaning.</p>
            <p>The turning point came early in my career when I discovered a book called &ldquo;Social
                Architecture&rdquo; by Pieter Hintjens. He was not a manager in the traditional sense &mdash; no MBA, no
                agile certifications &mdash; just a developer who built communities that outlasted him. His book was
                about how to run open-source projects, but what struck me was how these principles mirrored the best
                moments I had seen in high-performing teams: passion sustained, knowledge shared, trust unbroken.</p>
            <p>In my previous post, I described how I changed my team by using internal reporting. However, that was
                just the beginning of the journey, as it merely highlighted what was wrong and how to address the
                outstanding issues. To make the team rise above all expectations, I needed more. The principles
                described in Pieter's book allowed me to facilitate that growth.</p>

            <h2>Principle 1: Openness and Transparency</h2>
            <p>This principle laid the foundation of what I call &ldquo;reasonable transparency&rdquo;. Your team
                members need to know as much as possible about the project, promotions, and decision-making principles.
                When this visibility is given, the team starts trusting your management. It's important to keep
                that transparency because it starts diminishing as soon as secrets start seeping into your leadership
                style.</p>
            <p>Though you need to keep in mind that transparency has its limits. All NDAs, client confidentiality, and
                personal data must be protected. You always need to balance the price of sharing and withholding the
                information. For example, you might need to withhold profit margins or any other information that might
                harm team morale. In such cases, you should hint that you are restricted from sharing everything, as
                secrecy is a slippery slope, and you need to take into account that this information might eventually
                surface, ruining your reputation.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>Principle 2: Fair Process, Not Strong Leaders</h2>
            <p>One of the most humble lessons I've learned is that a project manager is not the main player on the
                team. We are not all-knowing experts, and we are not the ones who deliver the value of a project. In IT
                projects, developers and testers are, in construction, builders and architects. Actual industry
                professionals are bringing the value.</p>

            <p>Our true purpose is not to govern the team, but to shape, monitor, and adjust the processes in a way that
                would satisfy both your team and the project&apos;s needs. Processes that must be transparent,
                predictable, and fair to all team members. Processes that would allow your team to lead itself by making
                independent decisions that would serve both the team and the project.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Principle 3: Scalability Through Patterns</h2>
            <p>Eventually, you might need to extend your team. Unfortunately, scalability rarely happens by chance. The
                rare cases when this works are when the key members of the team are senior enough to cover scalability
                on their own. However, this itself is a challenge. Our job as managers is to design how our teams
                operate, and scalability is not an exception.</p>
            <p>Pieter Hintjens described 3 design patterns (yes, just like in programming) that are non-negotiable for
                your team to be scalable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ringtone - the project's heartbeat</strong>:&nbsp;<br>I strongly recommend
                        integrating this pattern into your ceremonies. And it's rather simple, especially if we
                        are using agile methodologies and frameworks, like Scrum. During your recurring events, it is
                        extremely valuable to share the project status with the team, share any project, team, or even
                        personal achievements. The idea behind this pattern is to remind people that the project is
                        alive. Without this communication, your team will start feeling that their contribution brings
                        no value.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Information River - the flow of knowledge</strong>:&nbsp;<br>Team scalability can't
                        happen without reliable and robust information channels. It's easy to set up a Slack or
                        Microsoft Teams group chat. However, this flow of knowledge requires maintenance; setting it up
                        is not enough. You need to ensure that all information is available to the relevant people, but
                        you also need to ensure you don't create a myriad of chats. Otherwise, you would risk
                        critical information being ignored. So separate those chats by topics, domains, or anything that
                        makes sense for your use case.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Liquid Democracy - decisions that flow:</strong><strong><br></strong>This pattern
                        optimises the decision flow. Define how choices are made, what thresholds count as consensus,
                        and who steps in when arbitration is needed. Think of it like real-world democracies: voting
                        continues until one option clearly emerges. The goal is not speed for its own sake, but
                        preventing valuable time from being wasted on endless debates over the trivial.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Principle 4: Low Barriers to Entry</h2>

            <p>This might surprise some people, but top-performing teams are also usually the easiest to join. At first,
                it might sound counterintuitive. After all, high-performing teams deliver more than others, and new
                joiners would be struggling to keep up. This might be the case if we were talking about teams consisting
                of super-starts (which I will cover in another post), but, in reality, high-performing teams are much
                easier to join than you think, because at the end of the day, a new-joiner will find it easier to join a
                team with great culture, which is exactly what makes high-performing teams so awesome.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Obviously, this does not happen by accident. Low barrier to entry needs to be designed. A logical start
                would be with the onboarding plan - not just a Confluence Page or a couple of videos. This needs to be a
                step-by-step guide covering the project fundamentals and processes. One thing that I found useful is
                planning some activities to cover part of the technical debt, improving code quality; this way, the
                developer would get acquainted with the code base, project architecture, and start gaining some tacit
                knowledge without the risk of breaking anything.</p>

            <p>Also, let's not forget about culture. It's even more important, yet much more challenging.
                All people are unique, and this may lead to complicated team dynamics. However, a welcoming culture is
                something that can be nurtured most of the time through coaching and various team-building activities.
                There are many techniques to do that, as there is no silver bullet. But it is our responsibility to find
                a way to remove friction and build trust in both the team and new people.</p>

            <h2>Principle 5: Toxicity Management</h2>
            <p>Toxicity poisons the team's culture, and given that productivity directly correlates with the
                team's culture, protecting it is not only the right thing from a moral perspective, but also is a
                must for your team to be productive. This is why it has to be dealt with swiftly and strategically. Like
                any other disciplinary measure, ideally, it should start with coaching - to give the person a chance to
                understand their impact and adjust. If it fails, rotation might be an option, moving them to a place
                where they could work without harming anyone. And obviously, you should consider termination only as a
                last resort.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While not all people are irredeemable, obviously the severity of the response needs to appropriately
                correspond to the severity of the deed. Some lines can not be crossed by anyone, like sexual harassment
                or racism. And obviously, you need to take the value of said individual. You wouldn't fire people
                like Linus Torvalds from the company. This is when dealing with toxicity becomes a challenge. This is
                why you need to know your people and how to coach them in this regard.</p>
            <p>I once heard a wise manager say,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Common sense is not that
                    common&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp;That's why culture needs explicit care, not assumptions. Teams thrive
                when people feel safe, supported, and respected. And when that safety is undermined, action must be
                taken &mdash; not later, but now.</p>
            <h2>Principle 6: Right to Fork</h2>
            <p>The beauty of open-source is that anyone can &ldquo;fork&rdquo; the codebase and adapt it to their need.
                This is how open source projects evolve and stay alive. In a corporate environment, this concept is less
                applicable, but it can still be applied to knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Teams thrive when they can learn. If knowledge is kept behind a safe door that would make Ocean's
                Eleven friends speechless, then the team growth will suffer. But when the knowledge is openly available,
                structured, and open to all, you remove the bus factor and ensure resilience to disastrous events, like
                the sudden departure of key team members or even of the entire team.</p>
            <p>The practices don't necessarily need to be complex. Record your knowledge transfer sessions, and
                make them as open as possible. Yes, confidentiality must be respected, client data and trade secrets
                must still be secured, but the knowledge on how to write good code, or some professional knowledge, can
                still be open.</p>
            <p>And another fascinating aspect of this is that when your team actively shares its knowledge, it grows not
                only in soft skills but in hard skills as well. And as a side effect, this kind of activity brings more
                talented individuals to your team.</p>
            <h2>Principle 7: Sustainability Over Speed</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is where many projects run into issues. Faced with deadlines, client pressure, there
                is often a temptation to do a quick and dirty fix or deliver something fast and fix it later. But then
                this later does not come. Building up a pile of issues. And this pile grows bigger and bigger, turning
                into an avalanche that destroys any hope for a working product. Unfortunately, this is not a
                dramatization. I've seen it happen several times.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speed has its place. In projects with a short life span, quick and dirty may even be the pragmatic
                choice. But for anything lasting, sustainability must sit alongside speed, or even should be higher on
                the priority list. The two are not opposites &mdash; they are partners. Without balance, momentum turns
                brittle.</p>
            <p>Workload is part of the same equation. Occasional crunch periods are necessary; most of us have lived
                through them. But when overtime becomes the norm, burnout follows quickly. No bonus or retention package
                can undo that once it sets in. Sustainable delivery depends on teams having the energy to show up again
                tomorrow with the same focus as today.</p>
            <p>There's an old proverb that captures this truth:</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse was lost. For want of a
                    horse, the rider was lost. For want of a rider, the message was lost. For want of a message, the
                    battle was lost. For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe
                    nail.&ldquo;</em></p>
            <p>Neglecting small essentials, such as technical debt, team health, and sustainable pace, can topple entire
                projects. Sustainability isn't a luxury; it's what keeps the work alive long after the
                deadlines have passed.</p>
            <h2>Principle 8: Shared Ownership and Meritocracy of Contribution</h2>
            <p>In essence, shared ownership means that all team members &mdash; no matter their rank, position, or
                tenure &mdash; own the project when it comes to decision-making, accountability, and ultimately its
                success. It is not about everyone having equal tasks, but about everyone having an equal voice. When
                people feel their perspective matters, they engage more deeply and commit more fully.</p>
            <p>This shifts the focus from individual achievements to collective outcomes and responsibility. It ensures
                that the team keeps a business-focused, value-driven mindset in their day-to-day work. For that to
                become a reality, processes must be rooted in meritocracy. Realizing this was an &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;
                moment for me: meritocracy and shared ownership together create a powerful source of intrinsic
                motivation for every team member.</p>
            <p>I learned this lesson early as a Scrum Master. My role was not to command but to serve &mdash; to keep
                the process healthy and the space safe. In my teams, voices were equal, and what emerged was not chaos
                but total buy-in. The energy that came from that sense of ownership was far greater than anything I
                could have imposed.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="conclusion-block">
                <!-- <img src="/articles/project-management/src/img/OpenSourceComunity.png"
                    alt="High Performing Teams Emblem" class="conclusion-emblem" /> -->
                <div class="conclusion-text">
                    <p>If you want people to go above and beyond, you have to create the conditions for it. That doesn't
                    happen through slogans or pressure, but through thoughtful design: teams built on fairness,
                    openness,
                    and ownership. People will give their best when they believe in the project, the process, or the
                    team
                    itself &mdash; and it's the leader's responsibility to make that belief possible.</p>
                <p>Open-source communities have shown us how this can work for decades. They thrive not because someone
                    demanded passion, but because the system itself invites it. Look at ZeroMQ: years after Pieter
                    Hintjens
                    passed, the project is still active, still evolving, and still guided by the principles he wrote
                    down.
                    That resilience is proof that the playbook works.</p>
                <p>The corporate world often chases high performance through control and urgency. But the lesson of open
                    source is different: performance comes from trust, shared ownership, and the willingness to adapt.
                    Build
                    that foundation, and your teams will not just deliver &mdash; they will endure, grow, and inspire.
