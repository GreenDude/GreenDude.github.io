  "headline": "Tailoring Burnout Recovery with the DiSC Model",
  "description": "Burnout doesn’t manifest the same way for everyone — it depends on how each person’s behavior and motivation interact with stress. The DiSC model offers a practical lens for understanding those differences, showing how Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness types each burn out and recover in unique ways. Unlike deeper personality theories like the Five-Factor Model, DiSC focuses on observable behavior, making it ideal for leaders and teams to recognize stress patterns in themselves and others.",
