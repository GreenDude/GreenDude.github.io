            <p>Life is chaotic. I realized this about ten years ago, and with it came another truth: any attempt to fully 
                control life is futile. Perhaps this is why agile project management has thrived while waterfall has 
                faded — but this article isn’t about project management. It’s about life, and how we navigate broken dreams 
                and unexpected setbacks.</p>
            <p>On the 1st of August, I lost my job. I won’t go into the reasons, but like many who face this hurdle, 
                I was devastated. And when people are devastated, they often do radical things. My “radical thing” 
                was beginning to plan relocation to another country — and that’s how I began learning Japanese.</p>
            <p>The Japanese language is beautifully intertwined with philosophy through its precise expressions. 
                While studying, I came across a proverb that reshaped how I see life: 一期一会 (Ichi-Go, Ichi-E), 
                which translates to “one time, one meeting.”</p>
            <p>At its core, the proverb is a reminder that every moment is unique — and will never come again. 
                When I reflected on losing my job, I asked myself: Was it sad? Yes. Will it ever happen in the exact same way again? 
                No. Is there something valuable I can take from it? Absolutely.</p>
            <p>That shift changed everything. Suddenly, what once felt like a painful loss became a liberating experience. 
                I had time to reflect, to learn something new, to reimagine my future. Losing a job that didn’t truly 
                fit me started to feel less like failure and more like freedom. Ichi-Go, Ichi-E reminded me to make the 
                most of the present.</p>
            <p>It also taught me to rethink the way I view time. Long family gatherings turned from “wasted hours” 
                into long opportunities for connection and recovery. Weeks of job searching became extended chances 
                for growth. Most importantly, it taught me not to rush through life. If you live only for the weekends, 
                you’re reducing your year to just 108 days — cutting away 253 days of your life. Why throw them out? 
                Live fully, one moment at a time. Ichi-Go, Ichi-E.</p>
            <p>Of course, not every moment feels good. Sometimes we fail. But even failure holds lessons. When you were 
                a kid and fell off a bike, maybe you cried — but you also learned balance. Psychologists call this 
                ‘post-traumatic growth’: the idea that setbacks can make us stronger if we frame them as learning 
                opportunities. Every moment gives us that choice: let the setback consume us, or learn from it. 
                In the past, I often chose the former. Lately, I’ve been choosing to grow. And in doing so, I’ve 
                rediscovered my passion, which I believe will fuel my future goals.</p>
            <p>Ichi-Go, Ichi-E is more than a proverb — it’s a way of managing both life and work. One moment, one meeting. 
                Each is unique. Each is a chance to learn. Each is never coming back. Whether we improve a moment or not 
                is secondary — the moment itself doesn’t need to be “fixed.” It simply is. And our task is not to control 
                it, but to appreciate it: to see its beauty, embrace its lessons, and above all, keep our balance.</p>
